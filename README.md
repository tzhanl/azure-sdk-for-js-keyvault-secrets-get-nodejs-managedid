# How to set and get secrets from Azure Key Vault with Azure Managed Identities and Node.js

## SDK Versions
In this sample, you will find the following folders:
* **v3** - references Key Vault SDK v3
* **v4** - references Key Vault SDK v4

## Introduction
This sample will show how a Web App gets a secret at runtime from Azure Key Vault using a developer account during development, and using Azure Managed Identities when deployed to Azure, without any code changes between local development environment and Azure. As a result, you don't have to explicitly handle a service principal credential to authenticate to Azure AD to get a token to call Key Vault. You also don't have to worry about renewing the service principal credential either, since Azure Managed Identities takes care of that.


## Prerequisites
To run and deploy this sample, you need the following:
* [Node.js]
* [Git]
* An Azure subscription to create a Key Vault and other services, such as App Service, used in this sample.
* An App registration to authenticate.

If you don't have an Azure subscription or App registration, create a [free account] or [App registration] before you begin.

### Step 1: Create an Azure Key Vault and add a secret
* Create an [Azure Key Vault] from Azure Portal.
* [Add a secret].

### Step 2: Grant yourself Secret Management access to the Key Vault
From the Azure Portal, go to the Key Vault's access policies, and grant yourself **Secret Management** access to the Key Vault. This will allow you to run the application on your local development machine.

* On your Key Vault **Settings** pages, Select **Access policies**.
* Click on **Add Access Policy**.
* Set **Configure from template (optional)** to **Secret Management**.
* Click on **Select Principal**, add your App registration.
* Click on **Add**.
* Click on **Save** to save the Access Policies.

## Local dev installation
1.  Clone the repository.

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-js-keyvault-secrets-get-nodejs-managedid.git
    ```

2.  Run the following command to install dependencies for "SDK version 3" and "SDK version 4":

    - SDK version 4

    ``` cmd
    cd v4
    npm install
    ```

    - SDK version 3

    ``` cmd
    cd v3
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up the following environment variables or replace these variables in the index.js file.

    Linux
    ``` bash
    export KEY_VAULT_URL = "<YourKeyVaultUrl>"
    export SECRET_NAME = "<YourSecretName>"
    export SECRET_VERSION = "<YourSecretVersion>"
    export AZURE_TENANT_ID = "<YourTenantId>"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID = "<YourClientId>"
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = "<YourClientSecret>"
    ```

    Windows
    ``` cmd
    setx KEY_VAULT_URL "<YourKeyVaultUrl>"
    setx SECRET_NAME "<YourSecretName>"
    setx SECRET_VERSION "<YourSecretVersion>"
    setx AZURE_TENANT_ID "<YourTenantId>"
    setx AZURE_CLIENT_ID "<YourClientId>"
    setx AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET "<YourClientSecret>"
    ```

4. Run the sample.

    ``` cmd
    node index.js
    ```

## Deploy this sample to Azure
1.  Create a [Node.js Web App] in Azure.

2.  Grant your Web App Secret Management access to the Key Vault.

    From the Azure Portal, go to the Key Vault's access policies, and grant your Web App **Secret Management** access to the Key Vault. This will allow you to run the application on your Web App.

    * On your Key Vault **Settings** pages, Select **Access policies**.
    * Click on **Add Access Policy**.
    * Set **Configure from template (optional)** to **Secret Management**.
    * Click on **Select Principal**, add your Web App's registration.
    * Click on **Add**.
    * Click on **Save** to save the Access Policies.

3.  Set environment variables in the **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Application Settings** of your Web App. You can also change the value of the variables from `null` in the index.js file.

4.  This repository is ready to be deployed using local git. Read this tutorial to get more information on [how to push using local git through portal].

## Troubleshooting
### Common issues across environments:
* Access denied

The principal used does not have access to the Key Vault. The principal used in show on the web page. Grant that user (in case of developer context) or application **Get secret** access to the Key Vault.
